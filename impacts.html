                <strong>Ocean Acidification:</strong>
                Increased atmospheric CO2 levels lead to ocean acidification, as the oceans absorb a significant portion
                of the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere.
                This affects marine ecosystems, particularly coral reefs, shellfish, and plankton, which are sensitive
                to changes in pH levels.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Loss of Biodiversity:</strong>
                Climate change threatens biodiversity by altering habitats, disrupting ecosystems, and affecting the
                distribution and behavior of plant and animal species.
                This can lead to species extinctions, loss of genetic diversity, and disruptions to ecosystem services
                that are essential for human well-being.
